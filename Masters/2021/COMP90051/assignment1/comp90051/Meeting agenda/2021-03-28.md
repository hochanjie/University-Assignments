Date: Sunday 28 March, 2021
Time: 2pm (Melbourne)
Location: Zoom
Attendees: Jessica Hu, Xianwei Gao

## Objectives
- [x] Introductions
- [x] Discuss ways to learn from graphs
- [x] Discuss how to approach the project

## Discussions

Missing Teammates
- Discussion:
  - Need to let the lecturer know
- Action:
  - [ ] Email lecturer

Graph ML
- Discussions:
  - (Xianwei)
    - Find the shortest path on the graph, and using probability between each edge and the distance between person A and person B, to calculate the probability (between zero-one).
    - Question: how to we verify the trained model is working correctly?
  - (Jess)
    - Question: does that mean we can only do unsupervised learning?
    - Showed research on `Edge Regression`
- Action:
  - [ ] Need to research how to learn edge probability from a graph (e.g. `link prediction`)

## Next Meeting
- TBD
