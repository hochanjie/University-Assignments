# Meeting Minutes
Date: Wednesday 31 March, 2021
Time: 6pm (Melbourne)
Location: Zoom
Attendees: Jessica Hu, Xianwei Gao, Chan Jie Ho

## Objectives
- [x] Introductions
- [x] Discuss ways to learn from graphs
- [x] Discuss how to approach the project

## Discussions

Graph ML
we currently only normalize frequency of the link, which doesn't have ML involves.
main questions is still what model should we use and how to train model
- Discussions:
  - (Xianwei)
    - shortest path approach doesn't get a good score and it is computationally expansive, need a new approach.
	
  - (Jess)
    - propose link/edge prediction, which need some research, and will try to build a network based on this.
	
  - (Chan Jie)
	- we should assume a prior of 50% of dataset are not real, and take this into account to our model, and will stick on Bayesian approach.
	
- Action:
  - Team merge in Kaggle. Done
  - Submit team name (SMLJ). Done
  - Explain our current code to Chan Jie. Done
## Next Meeting
- hopefully we all done our model, and improve our final model through discussion
