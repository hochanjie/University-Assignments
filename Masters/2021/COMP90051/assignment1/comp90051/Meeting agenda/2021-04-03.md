## Objectives
- [x] Talk about what we worked on and discovered
- [x] Talked about what features to have in the training model
- [x] Talked about problem of unbalanced test data

## Discussions

- shared links to different research we found
- decided on the following features to have (calculated against each edge):
  - Number of times coauthoring
  - Triadic closure
  - Jaccard Coefficient
  - Resource Allocation Index
  - Adamic Adar Index
  - Preferential Attachment
  - Community Common Neighbor
  - Community Resource Allocation
- talked about the problem of evaluating the model
  - if we split the training data in to train and testing, the testing data will always be predicting `True`, also the training data will be biased to `True` as well
- we should start working on the report

## Actions

- (Xianwei and Chan Jie) Work on generating the features
- (Jess) Work on researching how to train and evaluate the model performance
- (Chan Jie) Create google docs
- (Jess) Start on report once google docs have been created

## Next Meeting
TBD
