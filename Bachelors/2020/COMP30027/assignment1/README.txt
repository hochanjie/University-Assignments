================================================================================
To get the results I had gotten, just run the whole program. If you choose to 
test my program on datasets other than the one I had chosen for my examples, 
just assign the new dataset file name to the data variable. 

If the dataset is a nominal or ordinal dataset, the numeric variable should be 
set to None

If the dataset is a numeric dataset, the numeric variable should be set to 
"Numeric"

If the dataset is a mixed attributes dataset, the numeric variable should be the
Distribution of the types following the example given:

Attribute types (0=nominal, 1=ordinal, 2=numeric): 
    [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]

If you choose to try discretising the numeric or mixed attribute datasets, the 
discretise variable should be set to True
